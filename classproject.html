<!-- My Experience -->
<p>My familiarity has been limited thus 
far. Last year, I started on a journey
 into the diverse landscape of coding 
 languages and tools through a single 
 introductory course. However, since 
 completing that course, my engagement
  with coding platforms has been limited.
   I recognize the necessity of gaining 
   practical experience and becoming well-versed
    in the varied coding languages and platforms available.</p>
    


    <p>Within the scope of this course, my primary objectives 
        is around gaining a comprehensive understanding of various 
        coding platforms and their practical applications. Specifically,
        I aim to explore the use of different coding languages, delving
        into both the 'how' and 'why' behind their utilization. My ultimate
        goal out of this class is to develop the proficiency required to design
      and construct a website, or at the very least, to significantly advance
        toward that capability."</p>
