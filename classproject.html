   <p>My familiarity has been limited thus 
    far. Last year, I started on a journey
     into the diverse landscape of coding 
     languages and tools through a single 
     introductory course. However, since 
     completing that course, my engagement
      with coding platforms has been limited.
       I recognize the necessity of gaining 
       practical experience and becoming well-versed
        in the varied coding languages and platforms available.</p>
        


        <p>Within the scope of this course, my primary objectives 
            is around gaining a comprehensive understanding of various 
            coding platforms and their practical applications. Specifically,
            I aim to explore the use of different coding languages, delving
            into both the 'how' and 'why' behind their utilization. My ultimate
            goal out of this class is to develop the proficiency required to design
          and construct a website, or at the very least, to significantly advance
            toward that capability."</p>
